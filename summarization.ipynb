    "\n",
    "LLMs are a great tool for summarizing text content, given their proficiency in understanding and generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of [RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)](https://github.com/TCLee/rag-langchain), summarizing text can help distill the information in a large number of retrieved documents to provide context for a LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll go over how to summarize text content with 3 different strategies. First, we split/chunk a long piece of text into \"sub-documents\". Then, we'll explore the following strategies:\n",
    "- **Stuff**: Simply \"stuff\" all the documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach if all the documents can fit inside the model's context window.\n",
    "- **Map-Reduce**: Summarize each document in a `map` step and then `reduce` the summaries into a final summary. The `map` step is typically _parallelized_ over the input documents.\n",
    "- **Iterative Refinement**:\n",
    "    1. Summarize the first document.\n",
    "    2. Refine/update the result based on the next document.\n",
    "    3. Repeat through the sequence of documents until finished."

Additionally, the story touches on themes of secrets and hidden truths, with the underground vaults serving as a symbol of confinement and isolation. Ultimately, \"The Cask of Amontillado\" is a masterful exploration of the human psyche, revealing how seemingly innocent actions can lead to sinister consequences.\"\n"

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are a great tool for summarizing text content, given their proficiency in understanding and generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of [RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)](https://github.com/TCLee/rag-langchain), summarizing text can help distill the information in a large number of retrieved documents to provide context for a LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll go over how to summarize text content with 3 different strategies. First, we split or chunk a long piece of text into \"sub-documents\". Then, we'll explore the following strategies:\n",
    "- **Stuff**: Simply \"stuff\" all the documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach if the whole document can fit inside the model's context window.\n",
    "- **Map-Reduce**: Summarize each sub-document in _parallel_ in a `map` step and then `reduce` or consolidate the summaries into a final summary.\n",
    "- **Iterative Refinement**:\n",
    "    1. Summarize the first sub-document.\n",
    "    2. Refine/update the result based on the next sub-document.\n",
    "    3. Repeat through the sequence of sub-documents until finished.\n",

    "`Map-Reduce` flows are particularly useful when texts are too long to fit into the context window of a LLM. For long texts, we need to ensure that the number of tokens to be summarized in the `reduce` step does not exceed the LLM's context window. Here we implement a recursive `collapsing` of the summaries:\n",
